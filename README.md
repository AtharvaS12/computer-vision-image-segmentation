# Image Segmentation using Computer Vision

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **image segmentation techniques** using Python to partition an image into meaningful regions. Image segmentation is a fundamental task in **computer vision**, widely used in medical imaging, object detection, scene understanding, and image analysis.

The notebook focuses on applying classical image processing methods to extract and analyze different segments of an image.
